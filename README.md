- Clean, responsive UI
- Keyboard support (optional)

## Technologies
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- No frameworks or libraries

## What I Learned
- State management in pure JavaScript
- Event delegation and handling
- Algorithm design for mathematical operations
- Edge case handling and error prevention
- Code organization and refactoring
